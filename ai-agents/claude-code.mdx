Set up Claude Code to help you create AI videos with varg.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/docs) installed
- varg project initialized (`bun install vargai ai`)
- API keys configured (at minimum `FAL_KEY`)

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Claude Code">
  ```bash
  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Add varg Skill">
  In your project directory:

  ```bash
  npx skills add https://varg.ai/docs
  ```

  This gives Claude Code:
  - Component reference
  - Model information
  - Code templates
  - Best practices
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Project">
  Create or update `CLAUDE.md` in your project root:

  ```markdown
  # varg Video Project

  ## Commands
  - `bun run <file.tsx>` - Render video
  - `bunx vargai render <file.tsx>` - Alternative render

  ## Folders
  - `media/` - Input assets
  - `output/` - Generated videos

  ## API Keys
  Required in .env:
  - FAL_KEY (images, video)
  - ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (voice, music)
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Start Creating">
  ```bash
  claude
  ```

  Try:
  - "Create a 10-second TikTok video about cats"
  - "Make a talking character video with this script: ..."
  - "Generate a slideshow from these prompts: ..."
</Step>
</Steps>

## Example Prompts

### Simple Video

```
Create a simple 5-second video of a cute robot waving hello.
Use vertical format for TikTok.
```

### Talking Character

```
Create a talking character video with this script:
"Hey everyone! Today I'm going to share my top productivity tips."

Use a friendly female character with casual style.
Add TikTok-style captions and upbeat background music.
```

### Product Video

```
Create a product showcase video for wireless headphones.
Show the product rotating with text overlays highlighting features:
- Premium Sound
- 40hr Battery
- Active Noise Cancellation

End with a "Shop Now" call-to-action.
```

### Before/After

```
Create a transformation video showing a fitness journey.
Side-by-side comparison with "before" and "after" states.
Add motivational music and captions.
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific About Format

```
# Good
"Create a vertical 9:16 video for TikTok, 15 seconds max"

# Less specific
"Make a social media video"
```

### Include Style Details

```
# Good
"Pixar-style animated character, bright colors, friendly expression"

# Less specific
"Cute character"
```

### Specify Audio

```
# Good
"Add upbeat electronic background music at low volume, 
with word-by-word TikTok-style captions"

# Less specific
"Add music and captions"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "FAL_KEY not found"

Ensure your `.env` file has the API key:

```bash
echo "FAL_KEY=fal_xxx" >> .env
```

### "Video rendering failed"

- Check prompt doesn't violate content policy
- Try simpler motion descriptions
- Reduce video duration

### "Slow generation"

First run generates AI assets (1-2 min). Subsequent runs with same props are instant (cached).
